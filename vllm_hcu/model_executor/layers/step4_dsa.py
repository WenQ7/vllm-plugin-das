"""CSA/DSA driver ported from OpenDAS/vllm-hcu step37-dp.

Reference commit: 0686260600ad725f3c594a6ad9f5dd0a16830091.
The vendored step4_dsa_kernels module is kept byte-identical to that branch.
This driver adapts its region summaries, pending partial regions, and sparse
attention plans to vLLM's paged cache. Step5's layer wrappers bind V2 cache
views; its sliding attention layers use a separate HCU FlashAttention backend.

Each query scores 8-token regions and attends to the top 512 regions. When
4096 tokens cover the complete causal history, this matches dense attention.
Above that length the selected regions determine the sparse attention result.
Optional boltops and FlashAttention DSA stages are inherited from the source
branch; only the vendored BF16 path is validated for this Step5 adaptation.

# 2048 rows brings that to 67 MB, which is the only reason this knob exists --
# selection is per row, so the chunking changes nothing about the result.
# Query-axis chunking for prefill indexer scoring. Off by default, and the default
# is the point: it used to be 2048, which at a 65536-token prefill meant 32
# ``indexer_logits`` launches per request per DSA layer -- 6716 launches in one
# recorded 9-step trace -- plus two activation quantizations and four group copies
# each. The chunk existed only to bound the ``[groups * count, nscore]`` fp32
# temporary that ``indexer_logits`` used to return; now that the kernel scores
# directly into ``prefill_logits`` there is no temporary to bound, and the query
# axis was always grid dimension 0 anyway, so one launch does the same work.
#
# Measured on one 65536-token, 1023-region request (groups=4), per DSA layer:

# not the launch count -- collapsing 32 launches to 1 is only the last 0.15 ms,
# and it costs ~340 MiB of transient peak because the e4m3 copy of ``index_q`` is
# then made at full length. That peak is bounded by --max-num-batched-tokens and

#
# Only these two stages are switchable. The selector, indexer, CSA compression

# difference in output is attributable to the attention kernel alone.
#
# Two things the two libraries do not share:
#
# * boltops reads an fp8 cache but does not do fp8 *arithmetic*. As of its
#   commit 28239f4 both stages take ``k_scale``/``v_scale`` and dequantize a
#   ``float8_e4m3fn`` cache on load -- ``k_scale`` folded into ``softmax_scale``
#   on the host, ``v_scale`` applied to the fp32 output under an
#   ``APPLY_V_SCALE`` constexpr -- then widen to the query dtype before
#   ``tl.dot``. That matches the vendored copy at
#   ``VLLM_STEP4_DSA_FP8_MATH=off`` and nothing else: boltops has no equivalent
#   of ``qk_fp8``/``pv_fp8``, so an A/B against the server default compares two
#   different arithmetics, not two implementations of one.
#   boltops also keys its occupancy JSON on the *cache* dtype, because the query
#   stays bfloat16 on the fp8 path and the cache dtype is the only thing that
#   distinguishes it. ``_boltops_decode_config`` therefore has to pass both.
# * boltops decode owns its split count. ``num_splits=1`` there means "split to
#   fill the CUs and merge for me", so the ``_decode_num_splits`` policy and the
#   explicit ``merge_split_states`` pass are skipped on that path.

# consults those two flags for DSA layers -- and DSA layers bypass backend
# auto-selection entirely, wiring straight to ``Step4SparseAttentionBackend``
# in ``step4.py``. So without this switch, setting those two env vars makes
# sliding layers call flash_attn but leaves DSA on Triton. Default DSA to

#   prefill (8K queries): 9.2 ms off, 11.5 ms qk, 6.3 ms full
#
# ``full`` is the only one where an fp8 cache costs less latency than bf16 (77 us
# decode, 7.3 ms prefill) rather than more, and for prefill ``qk`` alone is the
# slowest of the four because the loop body holds both an fp8 K tile and a
# bf16-widened V tile and blows through the 256-VGPR budget (91 spills). ``full``

# acceptance envelopes (stage 6 for decode, stage 5 for prefill), so the operator
# suite does not bless what now runs by default. The fp8 cache by itself stays in
# the envelope because kernel and reference read the same fp8 bytes and the

    ``seq_lens_cpu``. Meta tensors stand in for the real ones.

    ``cache_dtype`` is passed separately from the query ``dtype`` because the
    selector keys its ``dtype`` entry off the KV cache: the query stays bfloat16
    on the fp8 serving path, so folding the two would resolve the bfloat16 tile
    for an fp8 cache.

    Returns ``{}`` -- which boltops reads as "keep the built-in tile" -- when
    nothing matches or the private selector has moved. Note that nothing matches
    on a device with no shipped JSON: the files are named after
    ``torch.cuda.get_device_name()``, and boltops ships ``BW1100`` -- aliased
    from ``BW1101`` since its commit 28239f4 -- plus ``BW200`` and ``K100_AI``.

    piecewise compilation, and a full-graph capture takes the whole forward

    12288 B DSA/SWA page is a 24x blowup: the summary pool would cost as much as
    the entire KV pool. Allocating here instead costs ``proxy_dim / (2 *
    head_dim * region_size)`` of the DSA KV pool -- about 4.2% at Step-4
    geometry -- and the exact figure is logged.

    **Addressing.** Physical KV block ``b`` owns summary rows ``[b *
    regions_per_page, (b + 1) * regions_per_page)``. Reusing the KV block id
    means no second block table and no second allocator.

    **Why block reuse needs no invalidation.** When a block is recycled its
    summary rows are stale, but only rows for *incomplete* regions can be: a
    region that fills is always overwritten as it fills. And an incomplete
    region's summary is never read -- the selector bounds each row's candidates
    to ``(past + len - 1) // region_size``, i.e. complete regions only, and the
    query's own partial region is force-included without consulting a summary.
    That is precisely why the reference refuses to store partial summaries.

        Every request contributes exactly one token, so it touches exactly one
        region and ``nregions == 1`` unconditionally. That removes the two things
        the general path loops for: the region count per request, and the packed
        buffer offset. Requests get a fixed stride of ``region_size`` in the
        compression buffer instead of being packed end to end -- the compression
        kernel addresses regions through ``starts``/``counts``, so the padding
        between them is never read, and in exchange the layout stops depending on
        the batch's sequence lengths.

        A region only becomes live when this token fills its last slot, i.e.
        ``(seq_len - 1) % region_size == region_size - 1``; otherwise ``counts``
        is zero and the compression kernel skips it, exactly as before.

        The physical summary slot per request comes from the block table, and
        slot-keying is what lets a partial region follow its request across
        batch reordering, so it has to be known on the host. It is *not* read
        back from the device: the block table is built on the host and uploaded,
        so ``md.block_table_np`` is the same data, and the slot arithmetic is
        repeated there. Reading it from the device tensor instead used to be the
        one blocking sync left in a decode step, which drained everything queued
        ahead of it and capped run-ahead at a single step. The device read
        remains as the fallback when no mirror is available.

        **Padded rows.** In a CUDA-graph batch the trailing rows are not
        requests: vLLM gives them ``seq_len = 0`` and a block table of
        ``NULL_BLOCK_ID`` (0, permanently reserved). Naively, ``past = -1`` makes
        ``first_region = -1`` and the gather indexes out of bounds. Every row is
        therefore masked by ``real = (seq_len > 0) & (page > 0)`` and a dead row
        is driven to a state that is inert everywhere downstream: ``counts = 0``
        so compression skips it, ``live = False`` so no summary is stored,
        ``nscore = 0`` so it scores nothing, pending routed to the trash row, and
        no entry in the host loop at all. That one mask covers dummy runs,
        capture, and replay padding alike, which is why
        ``build_for_cudagraph_capture`` needs no override.

        With ``persistent``, the results are written into the state's
        pre-allocated ``[max_num_reqs]`` buffers instead of freshly allocated
        ones, so their addresses survive from capture to replay.

        shared key head. Here the request axis moves into the launch grid and
        the kernel reads the summary pool in place through the block table, so
        nothing is gathered.

        Under ``graph_regions`` the score tensor is a slice of a pool allocated
        once, at a width that covers ``max_model_len`` rather than this batch's
        longest context, because a captured launch cannot resize. The slice is
        deliberately not cleared: a row is written for its own ``nscore``
        columns, the selector reads exactly ``(seq_len - 1) // region_size`` of
        them, and those are the same number -- so nothing this step did not

# The indexer as an opaque op
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Calling Step4Indexer.run() directly from Step4Attention.forward does not
# survive torch.compile. The model is traced once, during the profiling run,
# where attn_metadata is None -- so Dynamo takes run()'s early-return branch,
# bakes "do nothing" into the graph, and every real step afterwards reaches the
# attention layer with no plan at all. Even without that, the body is untraceable
# in principle: it branches on CPU sequence lengths and allocates tensors whose
# shapes depend on them.
#
# Wrapping it in a custom op fixes both. The body is never traced, it runs
# eagerly at the point the op appears in the graph, and the Python attribute it
# writes (layer.step4_sparse_plan) is set at execution time rather than trace
# time. This is exactly how vLLM's own DeepSeek indexer is wired
# (model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer.py:395).
#
# plan_token is what keeps the op alive. An op with no outputs and no declared
# mutations is dead code to the functionaliser; declaring the write makes the
# buffer a graph input that has to be updated, so the call is kept and stays
# ordered against the attention op that consumes its plan. The value written is
# the real one -- the number of scored regions this step -- so the buffer is
# also readable when debugging a layer that selected nothing.
#
# Being a custom op is necessary but NOT sufficient: the op must also be listed
# in CompilationConfig.splitting_ops. vLLM compiles piecewise and captures each
# piece between splitting ops into a CUDA graph, and a replayed graph re-runs
# recorded kernels, not Python -- so an unsplit indexer runs once, at capture
# time, and every subsequent step silently reuses that plan. vLLM's in-tree
# indexer is in the default list ("vllm::sparse_attn_indexer",
# config/compilation.py:750); this one is out of tree, so Step4Config.__init__
# appends it to CompilationConfig._attention_ops (see
# transformers_utils/configs/step4.py for why the registration lives there and
# not here). _require_splitting_op below is what turns a bypassed registration
# into a startup error instead of a wrong answer at the first request.
